linear regression model to predict the price of houses based on their squarefeet and no.bedrooms and bathrooms**



# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the price of houses based on their square feet area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses including their square feet area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding prices. The dataset is available in the file `house_data.csv`.

## Requirements
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `house_price_prediction.py` script:
   ```
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```
4. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the linear regression model, and evaluate the model's performance.
5. The predicted prices will be displayed along with the actual prices and the mean squared error.

## Results
The linear regression model achieves a mean squared error of X on the test set, indicating that it performs reasonably well in predicting house prices based on the given features.
